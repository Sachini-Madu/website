Torento Engineering Private Ltd, also known as Torento Shoe Machinery, is the pioneers and the only in Sri Lanka for manufacturing shoe making machineries, cutting dies and other accessories since 1986.

Torento Engineering Private Ltd started as Torento Engineering Enterprises as a partnership company by Jeewanasuri Dayantha Hempala de Soysa at domestic and very small level with his personal experience acquired from Ceylon Leather Products Corporation where mostly all shoe machineries were imported from other countries which is not affordable to small and medium scale industries at that time. However, we made the market to turn back to pursue Sri Lankan machineries for last three decades by maintaining the International standard in our products.

Further, in way back in year 1999 we started another company called Torento Cutting Dies to manufacture cutting dies and moulds to cater the continues request coming from our customers.
